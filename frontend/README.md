# Front-End Starter Template

This is a front-end web application for the Cardano Wyoming stable token poc that was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TypeScript, MUI, and Zustand. 

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

To get the application running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd yourrepository/frontend
    ```

3. Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. First, run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Project Structure

The template is organized as follows:

- **`frontend`**: The main application directory.
    - **`public`**: Contains public assets like HTML and images.
    - **`src/app`**: Contains the main source code for the application.
        - **`components`**: Reusable React components.
        - **`styles`**: Global styles and theme configuration.
        - **`store`**: Minimal lightweight store for global variables, functions, and types.
    

### Deploy on Vercel (optional)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
