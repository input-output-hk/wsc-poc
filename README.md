# Regulated stablecoin POC

This is a proof-of-concept for a regulated token with freeze and seize capabilities.

# Overview

The POC is based on [CIP-0143](https://github.com/colll78/CIPs/blob/patch-3/CIP-0143/README.md), instantiated with a programmable logic that checks whether the target address is blacklisted before allowing a transfer of the programmable token from one owner to another.

# Architecture

See [doc/architecture.md](doc/architecture.md)

## Contents of this repository

This repository contains 
* Prototype implementation of CIP-0143 in Plutarch
* Prototype implementation of Access Control Policy in Plutarch
* Transaction building code for initial deployment, minting programmable tokens, transferring programmable tokens, adding addresses to the blacklist (ie. freezing), and seizing funds from blacklisted addresses. Based on sc-tools and cardano-api.
* Emulator tests for the nominal cases (happy path) based on the actual ledger implementation and mainnet protocol parameters.
* A user interface that implements the use cases using browser-based wallets. Based on next.js and lucid.
* An OCI container image with the on-chain code, the off-chain code and the UI


With the container image it is possible to run the complete system locally with just a single command.
There is no need to install the build toolchain or to operate a cardano node or related infrastructure.
The image can even be used to interact with existing deployments of the POC.

# Usage

The easiest way to get started is by running the [wst](https://github.com/input-output-hk/wsc-poc/pkgs/container/wst) image locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --env WST_BLOCKFROST_TOKEN=previewXYZ ghcr.io/input-output-hk/wst:pr-67 manage 08a8d0bb8717839931b0a594f7c28b0a3b7c78f6e9172e977e250eab7637d879.0 start
```

Then open [localhost:8080/mint-authority.html](localhost:8080/mint-authority.html) in the browser.

Some notes
1. `podman` or others can be used instead of `docker`
2. `previewXYZ` must be replaced by a valid [blockfrost token](https://docs.blockfrost.io/#description/tokens) for the preview network
3. The tag `pr-67` corresponds to PR 67
4. `08a8d0bb8717839931b0a594f7c28b0a3b7c78f6e9172e977e250eab7637d879.0` is the transaction input that was used to initialise the deployment on the preview network.

# Contributing

## Backend

* Run the tests with `cabal test all`
* Enter the nix shell with `nix develop`

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

[!IMPORTANT]
Please make sure that the UI can be exported to a set of static assets.
This is necessary for the OCI image.
In particular, the command `npm run export` should succeed.
